**Overlapping subproblems** -  
whenever we end up solving same problem again and again, then it is called overlapping subproblems. 
  
If a subproblem has been already solved, will you again go and solve/recompute it?  
No.  
  
**Memoization**  -   
tend to store the value of subproblems in some map/table.
