**IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR INTERVIEW:**
1. solve the ques
2. effective communication
3. speed (solve follow-ups) (coding time should be in 5 mins - all other thinking time)
4. code quality
5. edge cases, dry run

**CODE QUALITY:**
1. break code into smaller functions
2. declare struct/class if you have multiple variables (to ease readability)
3. assign values to variables with suitable name  (rather than directly writing them) (if there is - or + modification with variable)
4. do iterations using reference (as reference takes lesser space)
