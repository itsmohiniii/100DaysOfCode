Intuition: Go left, left, left, then go right, right, right, again go left left left and then right, right, right and     
the print root only its left and right are both null.

**Time Complexity :**    
WC: if it is a skewed tree (which only has right children)     
N nodes will be inserted into the stack, so O(N) time to insert N nodes,   
and O(N) time to print N nodes which coming back
