Linear DS - array, stack, queue, Linked list, etc  
Hierarchical DS - trees, etc (eg, folder structure in computer)  
  
Binary means 0 and 1.  
**Binary Tree** - a hierarchical data structure which has at max 2 children nodes.

**Commonly used terms in trees:**  
Root   
Children  
Leaf node - a node which doesn't have children.  
Subtree of a node - node + beneath guys.  
Ancestors

**Types of Binary Tree**   
1. Full Binary tree
2. Complete Binary tree
3. Perfect Binary tree
4. Balanced Binary tree
5. Degenerate Tree

**I. Full Binary Tree**  
  
every node either has 0 or 2 children.

**IV. Balanced Binary Tree**  

generally used for efficient search or to improve the time complexity in BST.

**V. Degenerate Tree**  

a skewed tree or a linked list where every node has a single child.  

Degenerate tree example (if n=4 nodes):
