**A graph has :**
1. Node/vertex
2. Undirected edge (bidirectional) / Directed edge 
3. open/ enclosed structure

A binary tree is also a graph.  

**Types of graph:**
1. Undirected graph (Undirected edges)
2. Directed graph (directed edges, can have multiple directed edges bw 2 nodes)
3. Cyclic graph (start from one node and end at the same node)
4. Acyclic graph (no cycle)

DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

**Path** - 
1. A path contains a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable.
2. A node cant appear twice in a path.
3. Adjacent node must have an edge bw them.

**Edge weights** (unit weights i.e. 1, by default)

**For Undirected Graph** -
1. **Degree (node)** : no. of edges that are attached to that node 
2. Property : Total degree of a graph = 2 * no. of edges (Why? because every edge is connected to 2 nodes.)

**For Directed Graph** -
1. **InDegree (node)** : no. of incoming edges to that node 
2. **OutDegree (node)** : no. of outgoing edges from that node
