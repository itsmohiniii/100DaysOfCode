A graph has :
1. Node/vertex
2. Undirected edge (bidirectional) / Directed edge 
3. open/ enclosed structure

A binary tree is also a graph.  

Types of graph:
1. Undirected graph (Undirected edges)
2. Directed graph (directed edges, can have multiple directed edges bw 2 nodes)
3. Cyclic graph (start from one node and end at the same node)
4. Acyclic graph (no cycle)

DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

Path - 
1. contains a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable.
2. A node cant appear twice in a path.
3. Adjacent node must have an edge bw them.

**For Undirected graph**
Degree (node) - no. of edges that are attached to that node 

Property: 
Total degree of a graph = 2 * no. of edges 
Why? because every edge is connected to 2 nodes.
