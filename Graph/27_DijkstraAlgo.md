**Dijkstra algo can be implemented using following 3 ways :   **
1. using Queue (least optimised way)  
2. using Priority queue (min heap)  
3. using Set (best way)  
  
**Why PQ and not Q?**

  
  
Dijkstra Algorithm is only applicable for graphs with positive weights.  
Not applicable to graphs with negative weight.
